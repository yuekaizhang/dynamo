def _merge_chains(G: nx.DiGraph) -> nx.DiGraph:
    """
    Make the graph radix-like (meaning all unary paths are contracted).

    This function transforms a prefix tree into a radix tree structure by contracting
    unary paths (chains of nodes with exactly one predecessor and one successor).
    The resulting radix tree is significantly more compact than the original prefix tree,
    as it eliminates redundant intermediate nodes while preserving the structural
    information needed for path sampling.

    This compression is particularly beneficial for efficient path sampling during data
    synthesis. In addition, keep track of the contracted lengths in the 'length' attribute
    of each node to preserve the original path information.

    Args:
        G (networkx.DiGraph): A directed graph representing a prefix tree structure.

    Returns:
        networkx.DiGraph: The resulting radix tree with unary paths contracted.
