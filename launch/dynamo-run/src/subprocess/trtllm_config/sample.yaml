# This is a sample config for TensorRT-LLM engine.
# The config provides smaller free_gpu_memory_fraction to ensure that the engine
# does not use all the GPU memory and both prefill and decode workers can fit in
# the GPU memory when running in disaggregated mode.
# You might have to tweak this config based on your model size and GPU memory.
