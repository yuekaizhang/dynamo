# Deploying Inference Graphs to Kubernetes (`dynamo deploy`)

This guide explains the deployment options available for Dynamo inference graphs in Kubernetes environments.

## Deployment Options

Dynamo provides two distinct deployment options that each serve different use cases:
1. Dynamo Cloud Kubernetes Platform is preferred in cases that support it
2. Manual Deployment with Helm Charts is suited to users who need more control over their deployments


### Dynamo Cloud Kubernetes Platform [PREFERRED]

The Dynamo Cloud Platform (`deploy/cloud/`) provides a managed deployment experience:

- Contains the infrastructure components required for the Dynamo cloud platform
- Used when deploying with the `dynamo deploy` CLI commands
- Provides a managed deployment experience

For detailed instructions on using the Dynamo Cloud Platform, see:
- [Dynamo Cloud Platform Guide](dynamo_cloud.md): walks through installing and configuring the Dynamo cloud components on your Kubernetes cluster.
- [Operator Deployment Guide](operator_deployment.md)

### Manual Deployment with Helm Charts

Users who need more control over their deployments can use the manual deployment path (`deploy/helm/`):

- Used for manually deploying inference graphs to Kubernetes
- Contains Helm charts and configurations for deploying individual inference pipelines
- Provides full control over deployment parameters
- Requires manual management of infrastructure components
- Documentation:
  - [Using the Deployment Script](manual_helm_deployment.md#using-the-deployment-script): all-in-one script for manual deployment
  - [Helm Deployment Guide](manual_helm_deployment.md#helm-deployment-guide): detailed instructions for manual deployment

## Getting Started with Helm Deploym

1. **For Dynamo Cloud Platform**:
   - Follow the [Dynamo Cloud Platform Guide](dynamo_cloud.md)
   - Deploy a Hello World pipeline using the [Operator Deployment Guide](operator_deployment.md)
   - Deploy a Dynamo LLM pipeline to Kubernetes [Deploy LLM Guide](../../examples/llm_deployment.md#deploy-to-kubernetes)

2. **For Manual Deployment**:
   - Follow the [Manual Helm Deployment Guide](manual_helm_deployment.md)

## Example Deployments

See the [Hello World example](../../examples/hello_world.md#deploying-to-and-running-the-example-in-kubernetes) for a complete walkthrough of deploying a simple inference graph.

See the [LLM example](../../examples/llm_deployment.md#deploy-to-kubernetes) for a complete walkthrough of deploying a production-ready LLM inference pipeline to Kubernetes.
