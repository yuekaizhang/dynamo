# Deploying Dynamo Inference Graphs to Kubernetes

This guide provides an overview of the different deployment options available for Dynamo inference graphs in Kubernetes environments.

## Deployment Options

Dynamo provides two distinct deployment paths, each serving different use cases:

### 1. 🚀 Dynamo Cloud Kubernetes Platform [PREFERRED]

The Dynamo Cloud Platform (`deploy/dynamo/helm/`) provides a managed deployment experience:

- Contains the infrastructure components required for the Dynamo cloud platform
- Used when deploying with the `dynamo deploy` CLI commands
- Provides a managed deployment experience

For detailed instructions on using the Dynamo Cloud Platform, see:
- [Dynamo Cloud Platform Guide](dynamo_cloud.md): walks through installing and configuring the Dynamo cloud components on your Kubernetes cluster.
- [Operator Deployment Guide](operator_deployment.md)

### 2. Manual Deployment with Helm Charts

The manual deployment path (`deploy/Kubernetes/`) is available for users who need more control over their deployments:

- Used for manually deploying inference graphs to Kubernetes
- Contains Helm charts and configurations for deploying individual inference pipelines
- Provides full control over deployment parameters
- Requires manual management of infrastructure components
- Documentation:
  - [Deploying Dynamo Inference Graphs to Kubernetes using Helm](../../Kubernetes/pipeline/README.md): all-in-one script
  - [Manual Helm Deployment Guide](manual_helm_deployment.md): detailed instructions on manual deployment

## Getting Started

1. **For Dynamo Cloud Platform**:
   - Follow the [Dynamo Cloud Platform Guide](dynamo_cloud.md)
   - Deploy a Hello World pipeline using the [Operator Deployment Guide](operator_deployment.md)
   - Deploy a Dynamo LLM pipeline to Kubernetes [Deploy LLM Guide](../../../examples/llm/README.md#deploy-to-kubernetes)

2. **For Manual Deployment**:
   - Follow the [Manual Helm Deployment Guide](manual_helm_deployment.md)

## Example Deployment

See the [Hello World example](../../../examples/hello_world/README.md#deploying-to-and-running-the-example-in-kubernetes) for a complete walkthrough of deploying a simple inference graph.

See the [LLM example](../../../examples/llm/README.md#deploy-to-kubernetes) for a complete walkthrough of deploying a production-ready LLM inference pipeline to Kubernetes.
