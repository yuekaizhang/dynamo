# Deploying Inference Graphs to Kubernetes

High-level guide to Dynamo Kubernetes deployments. Start here, then dive into specific guides.

## 1. Install Platform First
**[Dynamo Kubernetes Platform](dynamo_cloud.md)** - Main installation guide with 3 paths

## 2. Choose Your Backend

Each backend has deployment examples and configuration options:

| Backend | Available Configurations |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **[vLLM](../../../components/backends/vllm/deploy/README.md)** | Aggregated, Aggregated + Router, Disaggregated, Disaggregated + Router, Disaggregated + Planner |
| **[SGLang](../../../components/backends/sglang/deploy/README.md)** | Aggregated, Aggregated + Router, Disaggregated, Disaggregated + Planner, Disaggregated Multi-node |
| **[TensorRT-LLM](../../../components/backends/trtllm/deploy/README.md)** | Aggregated, Aggregated + Router, Disaggregated, Disaggregated + Router |

## 3. Deploy Your First Model

```bash
# Set same namespace from platform install
export NAMESPACE=dynamo-cloud

# Deploy any example (this uses vLLM with Qwen model using aggregated serving)
kubectl apply -f components/backends/vllm/deploy/agg.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Check status
kubectl get dynamoGraphDeployment -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Test it
kubectl port-forward svc/agg-vllm-frontend 8000:8000 -n ${NAMESPACE}
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models
```

## What's a DynamoGraphDeployment?

It's a Kubernetes Custom Resource that defines your inference pipeline:
- Model configuration
- Resource allocation (GPUs, memory)
- Scaling policies
- Frontend/backend connections

The scripts in the `components/<backend>/launch` folder like `agg.sh` demonstrate how you can serve your models locally. The corresponding YAML files like `agg.yaml` show you how you could create a kubernetes deployment for your inference graph.

### Choosing Your Architecture Pattern

When creating a deployment, select the architecture pattern that best fits your use case:

- **Development / Testing** - Use `agg.yaml` as the base configuration
- **Production with Load Balancing** - Use `agg_router.yaml` to enable scalable, load-balanced inference
- **High Performance / Disaggregated** - Use `disagg_router.yaml` for maximum throughput and modular scalability

### Frontend and Worker Components

You can run the Frontend on one machine (e.g., a CPU node) and workers on different machines (GPU nodes). The Frontend serves as a framework-agnostic HTTP entry point that:

- Provides OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- Auto-discovers backend workers via etcd
- Routes requests and handles load balancing
- Validates and preprocesses requests

### Customizing Your Deployment

Example structure:
```yaml
apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DynamoGraphDeployment
metadata:
  name: my-llm
spec:
  services:
    Frontend:
      dynamoNamespace: my-llm
      componentType: frontend
      replicas: 1
      extraPodSpec:
        mainContainer:
          image: your-image
    VllmDecodeWorker:  # or SGLangDecodeWorker, TrtllmDecodeWorker
      dynamoNamespace: dynamo-dev
      componentType: worker
      replicas: 1
      envFromSecret: hf-token-secret  # for HuggingFace models
      resources:
        limits:
          gpu: "1"
      extraPodSpec:
        mainContainer:
          image: your-image
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
          args:
            - python3 -m dynamo.vllm --model YOUR_MODEL [--your-flags]
```

Worker command examples per backend:
```yaml
# vLLM worker
args:
  - python3 -m dynamo.vllm --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B

# SGLang worker
args:
  - >-
    python3 -m dynamo.sglang
    --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
    --tp 1
    --trust-remote-code

# TensorRT-LLM worker
args:
  - python3 -m dynamo.trtllm
    --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
    --served-model-name deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
    --extra-engine-args engine_configs/agg.yaml
```

Key customization points include:
- **Model Configuration**: Specify model in the args command
- **Resource Allocation**: Configure GPU requirements under `resources.limits`
- **Scaling**: Set `replicas` for number of worker instances
- **Routing Mode**: Enable KV-cache routing by setting `DYN_ROUTER_MODE=kv` in Frontend envs
- **Worker Specialization**: Add `--is-prefill-worker` flag for disaggregated prefill workers
