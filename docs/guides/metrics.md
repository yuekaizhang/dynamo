# Dynamo MetricsRegistry

## Overview

Dynamo provides built-in metrics capabilities through the `MetricsRegistry` trait, which is automatically available whenever you use the `DistributedRuntime` framework. This guide explains how to use metrics for observability and monitoring across all Dynamo components.

## Automatic Metrics

Dynamo automatically exposes metrics with the `dynamo_` name prefixes. It also adds the following labels `dynamo_namespace`, `dynamo_component`, and `dynamo_endpoint` to indicate which component is providing the metric.

**Frontend Metrics**: When using Dynamo HTTP Frontend (`--framework VLLM` or `--framework TRTLLM`), these metrics are automatically exposed with the `dynamo_frontend_*` prefix and include `model` labels containing the model name. These cover request handling, token processing, and latency measurements. See the [Available Metrics section](../../deploy/metrics/README.md#available-metrics) for the complete list of frontend metrics.

**Component Metrics**: The core Dynamo backend system automatically exposes metrics with the `dynamo_component_*` prefix for all components that use the `DistributedRuntime` framework. These include request counts, processing times, byte transfers, and system uptime metrics. See the [Available Metrics section](../../deploy/metrics/README.md#available-metrics) for the complete list of component metrics.

**Specialized Component Metrics**: Components can also expose additional metrics specific to their functionality. For example, a `preprocessor` component exposes metrics with the `dynamo_preprocessor_*` prefix. See the [Available Metrics section](../../deploy/metrics/README.md#available-metrics) for details on specialized component metrics.

**Kubernetes Integration**: For comprehensive Kubernetes deployment and monitoring setup, see the [Kubernetes Metrics Guide](dynamo_deploy/metrics.md). This includes Prometheus Operator setup, metrics collection configuration, and visualization in Grafana.

## Metrics Hierarchy

The `MetricsRegistry` trait is implemented by `DistributedRuntime`, `Namespace`, `Component`, and `Endpoint`, providing a hierarchical approach to metric collection that matches Dynamo's distributed architecture:

- `DistributedRuntime`: Global metrics across the entire runtime
- `Namespace`: Metrics scoped to a specific dynamo_namespace
- `Component`: Metrics for a specific dynamo_component within a namespace
- `Endpoint`: Metrics for individual dynamo_endpoint within a component

This hierarchical structure allows you to create metrics at the appropriate level of granularity for your monitoring needs.


## Getting Started

For a complete setup guide including Docker Compose configuration, Prometheus setup, and Grafana dashboards, see the [Getting Started section](../../deploy/metrics/README.md#getting-started) in the deploy metrics documentation.

The quick start includes:
- Docker Compose setup for Prometheus and Grafana
- Pre-configured dashboards and datasources
- Access URLs for all monitoring endpoints
- GPU targeting configuration

## Implementation Examples

See [Implementation Examples](../../deploy/metrics/README.md#implementation-examples) for detailed examples of creating metrics at different hierarchy levels and using dynamic labels.

### Grafana Dashboards

Use dashboards in `deploy/metrics/grafana_dashboards/`:
- `grafana-dynamo-dashboard.json`: General Dynamo dashboard
- `grafana-dcgm-metrics.json`: DCGM GPU metrics dashboard

## Metrics Visualization Architecture

### Service Topology

The metrics system follows this architecture for collecting and visualizing metrics:

    end
```

### Grafana Dashboard

The metrics system includes a pre-configured Grafana dashboard for visualizing service metrics:
