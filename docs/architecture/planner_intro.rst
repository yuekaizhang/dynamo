Planner
=======

The planner monitors the state of the system and adjusts workers to ensure that the system runs efficiently.

Currently, the planner can scale the number of vllm workers up and down based on the kv cache load and prefill queue size:

Key features include:

* **Load-based scaling** that monitors KV cache utilization and prefill queue size to make scaling decisions
* **SLA-based scaling** that uses predictive modeling and performance interpolation to proactively meet TTFT and ITL targets
* **Graceful scaling** that ensures no requests are dropped during scale-down operations
