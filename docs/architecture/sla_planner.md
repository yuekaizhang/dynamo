# SLA-based Planner

This document covers SLA-based planner in `examples/common/utils/planner_core.py`.

The SLA (Service Level Agreement)-based planner is an intelligent autoscaling system that monitors system performance and adjusts the number of prefill and decode workers to meet specified TTFT and ITL targets. Unlike the load-based planner that scales based on resource utilization thresholds, the SLA planner uses predictive modeling and performance interpolation to proactively scale the workers.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, SLA-based planner only supports disaggregated setup.

## Features

* **SLA-driven scaling**: Automatically scales prefill/decode workers to meet TTFT and ITL targets
* **Predictive load forecasting**: Uses ARIMA, Prophet, or constant predictors to forecast future load
* **Performance interpolation**: Leverages profiling results data from pre-deployment profiling for accurate scaling decisions
* **Correction factors**: Adapts to real-world performance deviations from profiled data

## Architecture

The SLA planner consists of several key components:

1. **Load Predictors**: Forecast future request patterns (number of requests, input/output sequence lengths)
2. **Performance Interpolators**: Estimate TTFT and ITL based on profiled performance data
3. **Correction Factors**: Adjust predictions based on observed vs. expected performance
4. **Scaling Logic**: Calculate optimal number of prefill/decode replicas to meet SLA targets

## Pre-Deployment Profiling

Before using the SLA planner, you must profile the performance of the selected model and GPU to generate interpolation data:

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/benchmarks/profiler/
python -m profile_sla \
  --backend <vllm_v0/vllm_v1> \
  --config <path-to-dynamo-config-file> \
  --output-dir <path-to-profile-results-dir> \
  --isl <target-input-sequence-length> \
  --osl <target-output-sequence-length> \
  --ttft <target-ttft-ms> \
  --itl <target-itl-ms>
```

This script will:
- Profile prefill performance across different tensor parallelism (TP) sizes
- Profile decode performance under various concurrency levels
- Recommend optimal TP configurations and scaling thresholds
- Generate interpolation data for the recommended TP configuration

### Prefill Interpolation Data

In prefill engine, prefills are usually done with batch size=1 and only the ISL (excluding prefix cache hit) affects the iteration time. The script profiles the selected prefill TP configuration across different ISLs and record the TTFT and prefill throughput per GPU under those ISLs.

### Decode Interpolation Data
In decode engine, decode requests are added inflight and iteration time (or ITL) depends on both the context length and the real-time load of the engine. We capture the real-time load of the engine with active kv usage and average context length. The active kv usage determines the complexity of the memory-bounded attention kernel while the active kv usage divided the average context length determines the complexity of the computation bound MLP kernel. For example, the below figure shows the ITL of DS-Distilled Llama 8b model on H100 TP4. The ITL grows near-linearly with active kv usage under a fixed context length. And the slope increases as the context length decreases.

The script profiles the selected decode TP configuration across different active kv blocks and average context length.

## Load Prediction

The SLA planner use load predictor to predict the number of requests, ISL, and OSL in the next adjustment interval. Currently, three load prediction model is supported:

### Constant Predictor
- **Use case**: Stable and long prediction interval
- **Behavior**: Assumes next load equals current load
- **Configuration**: `load-predictor: "constant"`

### ARIMA Predictor
- **Use case**: Time-series data with trends and seasonality
- **Behavior**: Uses auto-ARIMA to fit optimal model parameters
- **Configuration**: `load-predictor: "arima"`

### Prophet Predictor
- **Use case**: Complex seasonal patterns and trend changes
- **Behavior**: Facebook's [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) model for time-series forecasting
- **Configuration**: `load-predictor: "prophet"`

## Scaling Algorithm

SLA planner uses a sophisticated scaling algorithm. At each adjustment interval, SLA planner performs the following operations:

### 1. Metric Collection
Every adjustment interval, collect:
- Average Time to First Token (TTFT)
- Average Inter-Token Latency (ITL)
- Request count and duration
- Input/Output sequence lengths

### 2. Correction Factor Calculation
Using the collected metrics, SLA planner applies the interpolator to find out the expected TTFT/ITL and calibrate the interpolation model. This step is important because the actual TTFT/ITL can often be different than the ideal world:
- **TTFT**: actual TTFT heavily depends on request queueing and prefix cache hit rate (if use kv reuse). For example, if all requests arrives at the beginning of the adjustment interval, they queue heavily and TTFT will be significantly higher. If prefix cache hit rate is very high, the actual number of tokens in the prefill will be very low and TTFT will be significantly lower.
- **ITL**: actual ITL maybe affected by chunked small prefill request in decode engine.
- **Metric variances**: large variances in request rate, ISL, and OSL may lead to inaccurate estimation of the TTFT/ITL since SLA only consider the average when interpolating.

SLA planner calculate the correction factor with
- **Prefill correction**: `actual_ttft / expected_ttft`
- **Decode correction**: `actual_itl / expected_itl`

### 3. Load Prediction
SLA planner forecasts these metric in the next interval using the load predictor
- Number of requests
- Input sequence length
- Output sequence length

### 4. Calculating Number of Replicas

**Prefill replicas**: SLA planner assumes the prefill correction factor has linear affect on the prefill throughput per GPU as prefill is single-batched.
```
predicted_load = next_requests * next_isl / interval * min(1, prefill_correction)
prefill_replicas = ceil(predicted_load / interpolated_throughput / gpus_per_engine)
```

**Decode replicas**:
```
# 1. apply d_correction_factor to the ITL SLA
corrected_itl = self.args.itl / self.d_correction_factor
# 2. reversely find out what is best throughput/gpu that can achieve corrected_itl under the predicted context length
pred_decode_thpt_per_gpu = self.decode_interpolator.find_best_throughput_per_gpu(
    itl=corrected_itl,
    context_length=next_isl + next_osl / 2
)
# 3. compute number of decode replicas needed
next_num_d = math.ceil(next_num_req * next_osl / self.args.adjustment_interval / pred_decode_thpt_per_gpu / self.args.decode_engine_num_gpu)
```

### 5. Scaling

Finally, SLA planner applies the change by scaling up/down the number of prefill and decode workers to the calculated number of replica in the next interval.

> [!NOTE]
> SLA-planner scales up/down the P/D engines non-blockingly. If `adjustment-interval` is too short, the previous scaling operations may not finish before the new scaling operations are issued. Make sure to set a large enough `adjustment-interval`.

## Deploying

To deploy SLA-planner, use the rust frontend (`dynamo-run`) that reports metrics at `/metrics` HTTP endpoint. You can also use your own frontend, but it must report number of requests, ISL, OSL, TTFT, ITL in the same format.

SLA-planner and prometheus server are provided as common components that can be directly imported from `dynamo` package. The following changes are needed:
- Add `Planner` and `Prometheus` components' dependency in `Frontend`.
- Link `Planner` and `Prometheus` in the graph.
- Add `Planner` and `Prometheus` configurations in the config file.

A `vllm_v0` example is available for reference:
```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/vllm_v0
dynamo serve graphs.disagg_planner:Frontend -f ./configs/disagg_planner.yaml
```
