# Steps to deploy vLLM example

## 1. Deploy Dynamo Graph

```
cd dynamo/components/backends/vllm/deploy
vim agg_router.yaml    #under metadata add namespace: dynamo-cloud and change image to your built base image
kubectl apply -f agg_router.yaml
```

Your pods should be running like below

```
ubuntu@ip-192-168-83-157:~/dynamo/components/backends/vllm/deploy$ kubectl get pods -A
