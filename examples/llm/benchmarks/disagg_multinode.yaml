  # Routing policy determines how remote workers are selected for processing
  # prefill requests
  # 1. random: randomly select workers for prefill requests
  # 2. round-robin: different prefill requests take similar time to complete so
  #                 selecting workers in round-robin maximizes the chance of
  #                 selecting the least busy worker for a request
  # 3. kv: finding prefill workers by KV cache is not beneficial when caching is
  #        disabled on this setup
