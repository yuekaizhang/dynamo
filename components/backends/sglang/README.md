# LLM Deployment using SGLang

This directory contains an SGLang component for Dynamo and reference implementations for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in various configurations using SGLang. SGLang internally uses ZMQ to communicate between the ingress and the engine processes. For Dynamo, we leverage the runtime to communicate directly with the engine processes and handle ingress and pre/post processing on our end.

## Use the Latest Release

We recommend using the latest stable release of dynamo to avoid breaking changes:

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ai-dynamo/dynamo)](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/releases/latest)

You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/releases/latest) and check out the corresponding branch with:

```bash
git checkout $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
```

## Quick Start

Below we provide a guide that lets you run all of our the common deployment patterns on a single node. See our different [architectures](../llm/README.md#deployment-architectures) for a high level overview of each pattern and the architecture diagram for each.

### Start NATS and ETCD in the background

Start using [Docker Compose](../../../deploy/docker-compose.yml)

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Build container

```bash
# pull our pre-build sglang runtime container
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/sglang-runtime:0.3.2
# or build from source
./container/build.sh --framework sglang
```

### Run container

```bash
./container/run.sh -it --framework sglang
```

## Run Single Node Examples

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each example corresponds to a simple bash script that runs the OpenAI compatible server, processor, and optional router (written in Rust) and LLM engine (written in Python) in a single terminal. You can easily take each command and run them in separate terminals.
>
> Additionally - because we use sglang's argument parser, you can pass in any argument that sglang supports to the worker!


### Aggregated Serving

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_ROOT/components/backends/sglang
./launch/agg.sh
```

### Aggregated Serving with KV Routing

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_ROOT/components/backends/sglang
./launch/agg_router.sh
```

### Disaggregated serving

<details>
<summary>Under the hood: SGLang Load Balancer vs Dynamo Discovery</summary>

SGLang uses a mini load balancer to route requests to handle disaggregated serving. The load balancer functions as follows:

1. The load balancer receives a request from the client
2. A random `(prefill, decode)` pair is selected from the pool of available workers
3. Request is sent to both `prefill` and `decode` workers via asyncio tasks
4. Internally disaggregation is done from prefill -> decode

Because Dynamo has a discovery mechanism, we do not use a load balancer. Instead, we first route to a random prefill worker, select a random decode worker, and then send the request to both. Internally, SGLang's bootstrap server (which is a part of the `tokenizer_manager`) is used in conjuction with NIXL to handle the kv transfer.

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disaggregated serving in SGLang currently requires each worker to have the same tensor parallel size [unless you are using an MLA based model](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/5922)

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_ROOT/components/backends/sglang
./launch/disagg.sh
```

### Disaggregated Serving with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and DP attention

You can use this configuration to test out disaggregated serving with dp attention and expert parallelism on a single node before scaling to the full DeepSeek-R1 model across multiple nodes.

```bash
# note this will require 4 GPUs
cd $DYNAMO_ROOT/components/backends/sglang
./launch/disagg_dp_attn.sh
```

When using MoE models, you can also use the our implementation of the native SGLang endpoints to record expert distribution data. The `disagg_dp_attn.sh` script automatically sets up the SGLang HTTP server, the environment variable that controls the expert distribution recording directory, and sets up the expert distribution recording mode to `stat`. You can learn more about expert parallelism load balancing [here](docs/expert-distribution-eplb.md).

## Request Migration

You can enable [request migration](../../../docs/architecture/request_migration.md) to handle worker failures gracefully. Use the `--migration-limit` flag to specify how many times a request can be migrated to another worker:

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.sglang ... --migration-limit=3
```

This allows a request to be migrated up to 3 times before failing. See the [Request Migration Architecture](../../../docs/architecture/request_migration.md) documentation for details on how this works.
