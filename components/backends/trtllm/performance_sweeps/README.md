# TensorRT-LLM Benchmark Scripts for DeepSeek R1 model

This directory contains scripts for benchmarking TensorRT-LLM performance with Dynamo using SLURM job scheduler.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER
**These scripts are currently not QA'ed and are provided for demonstration purposes only.**

Please note that:

- These scripts have not undergone formal quality assurance testing
- They were executed on GB200 systems
- They are intended for demonstration and educational purposes
- Use at your own risk in production environments
- Always review and test scripts thoroughly before running in your specific environment
- We are actively working on refining the configuration sweeps.

## Scripts Overview

### Core Scripts

1. `submit.sh` - Main entry point for submitting benchmark jobs for disaggregated configurations. This includes WideEP optimization for DEP>=16.
2. `submit_agg.sh` - Main entry point for submitting benchmark jobs for aggregated configurations.
3. `post_process.py` - Scan the genai-perf results to produce a json with entries to each config point.
4. `plot_performance_comparison.py` - Takes the json result file for disaggregated and/or aggregated configuration sweeps and plots a pareto line for better visualization.

For more finer grained details on how to launch TRTLLM backend workers with DeepSeek R1 on GB200 slurm, please refer [multinode-examples.md](../multinode/multinode-examples.md). This guide shares similar assumption to the multinode examples guide.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have:
1. Access to a SLURM cluster
2. Container image of Dynamo with TensorRT-LLM built using instructions from [here](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/components/backends/trtllm#build-docker).
3. Model files accessible on the cluster
4. Required environment variables set

### Setup

Within the login node of the cluster, set the following variables

```bash
# Set partition manually based on your slurm cluster's partition names
export SLURM_PARTITION=""

# Set account manually if this command doesn't work on your cluster
export SLURM_ACCOUNT="$(sacctmgr -nP show assoc where user=$(whoami) format=account)"

# Set a job name for your benchmarking runs
export SLURM_JOB_NAME=""

# NOTE: IMAGE must be set manually for now
# To build an iamge, see the steps here:
# https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/components/backends/trtllm#build-docker
export IMAGE="<dynamo_trtllm_image>"

# NOTE: In general, Deepseek R1 is very large, so it is recommended to
# pre-download the model weights and save them in some shared location,
# NFS storage, HF_CACHE, etc. and modify the `--model-path` below
# to reuse the pre-downloaded weights instead.
#
# On Blackwell systems (ex: GB200), it is recommended to use the FP4 weights:
# https://huggingface.co/nvidia/DeepSeek-R1-FP4
#
# On Hopper systems, FP4 isn't supported so you'll need to use the default weights:
# https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1
export MODEL_PATH="<path_to_model_weights>"

# The name the model will be served/queried under, matching what's
# returned by the /v1/models endpoint.
#
# By default this is inferred from MODEL_PATH, but when using locally downloaded
# model weights, it can be nice to have explicit control over the name.
export SERVED_MODEL_NAME="nvidia/DeepSeek-R1-FP4"
```

## Launching benchmarking sweeps for different configurations

### Aggregated

```bash
# Queues the SLURM jobs for aggregated configurations for DeepSeek R1.
./submit_agg.sh
```

### Disaggregated (Includes WideEP) - MTP off

```bash
# Queues the SLURM jobs for disaggregated configurations for DeepSeek R1 without MTP
./submit.sh mtp=off all
```

### Disaggregated (Includes WideEP) - MTP on

```bash
# Queues the SLURM jobs for disaggregated configurations for DeepSeek R1 with MTP
./submit.sh mtp=on all
```

## Post-Processing Results

The above jobs use genAI-perf tool to benchmark each configuration point across different concurrency values. These get stored in `dynamo_disagg-bm-8150-1024/<config-setup>/genai_perf_artifacts` and `dynamo_agg-bm-8150-1024/<config-setup>/genai_perf_artifacts` for disaggregated and aggregated respectively.

After your benchmarking jobs have completed, you can use the `post_process.py` script to aggregate and summarize the results from the generated genai_perf_artifacts.

To run the post-processing script, use:

### Aggregated

```bash
python3 post_process.py dynamo_agg-bm-8150-1024 --output-file agg_result.json
```

### Disaggregated

```bash
python3 post_process.py dynamo_disagg-bm-8150-1024 --output-file disagg_result.json
```

## Ploting Performance

You can now use the `plot_performance_comparison.py` like below to observe the performance.

```bash
python3 plot_performance_comparison.py dynamo_agg-bm-8150-1024/agg_result.json dynamo_disagg-bm-8150-1024/disagg_result.json -o performance_plot.png
```

This script will produce a scatter plot of all the configuration points with each concurrency on a Output Throughput per GPU vs Output Throughput per User. It will also include the roofline pareto line for both aggregated and disaggregated setups.

Refer to [Beyond the Buzz: A Pragmatic Take on Inference Disaggregation](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.05508v1) to learn how to interpret these plots.

## Known Issues

- Some jobs may time out if genai-perf requires more time to complete all concurrency levels.
- Workers may encounter out-of-memory (OOM) errors during inference, especially with larger configurations.
- Configurations affected by these issues will result in missing data points on the performance plot.
